# Gallstone Classification Project   

 

## Project Description   



This project uses the **Gallstone-1 dataset** to study patterns in patient health data and to build predictive models that can help identify 
whether a person is at risk of developing gallstones.


Gallstones are a widespread health issue that can cause severe abdominal pain and other complications if not detected early. By analyzing medical attributes such as age, weight, cholesterol, and lifestyle factors, our goal is to:


- **Support Early Detection**: Provide insights that could assist doctors in recognizing patients at higher risk.  
- **Reduce Complications**: Early predictions can help patients take preventive measures before gallstones become severe.  
- **Promote Healthcare Awareness**: Show how data analysis can contribute to real-world medical challenges and improve quality of life.  


In addition to prediction, we also explore **clustering methods** to see if patients naturally group into patterns that may not be immediately visible to medical staff.
This could provide additional knowledge for research and public health.

## Motivation   

Gallstones are one of the most common digestive diseases. Early diagnosis can reduce pain, 
improve treatment decisions, and help patients avoid serious complications.   


We chose this dataset because it represents a real medical challenge and allows us to 
practice both **classification and clustering** methods in a way that is socially impactful.
